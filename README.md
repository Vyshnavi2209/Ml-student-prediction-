# Student Score Prediction using Machine Learning

## Domain
Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple Machine Learning model that predicts student exam scores based on the number of hours studied. The aim is to show how supervised learning can be used to identify patterns in data and make predictions.

## Objective
To build a prediction model that estimates a student’s expected score using study hours as the input feature.

## Dataset
A sample dataset is used containing:
- Hours_Studied – Number of hours spent studying
- Scores – Marks obtained in exams

This dataset helps the model learn the relationship between study time and performance.

## Model Used
Linear Regression is used for this project because:
- It is simple and effective for prediction problems
- It works well with continuous numerical data
- It helps understand the relationship between input and output

## Working Process
1. Create a dataset with study hours and scores  
2. Split data into training and testing sets  
3. Train the Linear Regression model  
4. Predict scores for new study hours  
5. Evaluate model accuracy  

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Output
The model predicts the expected score for a given number of study hours.

Example:
Input: 5 hours  
Output: Predicted exam score

## Use Cases
- Academic performance prediction  
- Student progress analysis  
- Educational data analysis  

## Conclusion
This project shows how Machine Learning can be used to predict outcomes based on past data. By analyzing study hours and exam scores, the model can estimate student performance and demonstrate the basic concept of predictive analytics.
